# NullWiiCon

## What is this?

So, I *love* the Super Nintendo (and SNES Classic) controller, and I love my Nintendo Switch and PC. And while the SN30 wasn't that bad, I wanted something that was wired and worked properly with the Switch Online SNES Emulator. (To use the menu/rewind, you have to press ZL and ZR, and the SN30 only does L and R)
